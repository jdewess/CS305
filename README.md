# CS 305 Portfolio Submission – Module Eight Journal

## Artifact
For this submission, I am including my **Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report**. This document demonstrates my ability to refactor code securely, apply encryption standards, and strengthen communications through industry best practices.

## Reflection

**1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements.**  
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that needed secure software practices to protect client data and financial transactions. The company asked for solutions to secure their communication systems, prevent vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with security standards.  

**2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**  
I did well at identifying risks related to unencrypted data and weak communication protocols. Coding securely prevents exploitation, protects sensitive information, and builds customer trust. Strong software security adds value by reducing liability, avoiding breaches, and ensuring business continuity.  

**3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**  
The dependency-checking process was the most helpful, as it revealed outdated libraries that could introduce risks. It was also challenging to balance performance with security when refactoring the code.  

**4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**  
I added multiple layers of security including AES encryption, SHA-256 hashing, HTTPS protocol enforcement, and secure certificate management. In the future, I would use tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check, static code analysis, and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.  

**5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**  
I verified functionality through secondary and functional testing, executing the refactored code without errors. I then ran dependency-check reports and checksum validation to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.  

**6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**  
I used AES encryption, SHA-256 hashing, HTTPS configuration, and dependency management tools. Following OWASP guidelines and secure coding practices will also be valuable in future projects.  

**7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**  
I would showcase the secure software practices report and the refactored codebase as evidence of my ability to identify vulnerabilities, apply industry-standard encryption, and deliver secure, functioning software for a client in the financial sector.
